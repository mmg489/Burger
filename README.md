<h2>This app makes use of: Node Express Handlebars</h2>

-A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. Uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

<h4>How it works:</h4>

This is an app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the upper portion of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the lower bottom portion of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
